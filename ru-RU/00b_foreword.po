msgid "Linux has been garnering strength for the last few years, and its growing popularity drives more and more users to make the jump. The first step on that path is to pick a distribution. This is an important decision, because each distribution has its own peculiarities, and future migration costs can be avoided if the right choice is made from the start."
msgstr "В последние годы Linux стремительно развивается, а его растущая популярность привлекает всё новых и новых пользователей. Первый шаг на этом пути - выбор дистрибутива. Это важное решение, потому что каждый дистрибутив имеет свою специфику. И правильный выбор, сделанный на первых порах, позволит избежать дальнейших метаний между дистрибутивами."

At that time, many other books were written on the topic both for French-speaking and English-speaking readers. Unfortunately almost none of them got updated, and today we again find ourselves in a situation where there are very few good books on Debian. We truly hope that this first English edition will fill this gap and help many users."

Поэтому мы снова оказались в ситуации, когда очень мало качественных актуальных книг по Debian. Мы надеемся, что это первое английское издание заполнит этот пробел и поможет многим пользователям."
