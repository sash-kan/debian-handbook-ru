msgid "A locale is a group of regional settings. This includes not only the language for text, but also the format for displaying numbers, dates, times, and monetary sums, as well as the method for alphabetical comparison (for alphabetically ordering items, to include accented characters, where applicable). Although each of these parameters can be specified independently from the others, we generally will use one locale, which is a coherent set of values for these parameters corresponding to a “region” in the broadest sense. These locales are usually indicated under the form, <literal><replaceable>language-code</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY-CODE</replaceable></literal>, sometimes with a suffix to specify the character set and encoding to be used. This enables consideration of idiomatic or typographical differences between different regions with a common language."

Каждый из этих параметров может быть определён независимо от остальных, но в большинстве случаев мы будем использовать одну языковую настройку, которая представляет из себя согласованный набор величин для этих параметров и соответствует определению “регион” в самом широком смысле. Эти языковые настройки обычно представляются в виде <literal><replaceable>код-языка</replaceable>_<replaceable>КОД-СТРАНЫ</replaceable></literal>, иногда с суффиксом, указывающим используемый набор символов и кодировок.

The one drawback is that it had to go through a rather difficult transition phase. Since it could not be completely transparent (that is, it could not happen at the same time all over the world over), two conversion operations were required: one on file contents, and the other on filenames. Fortunately, the bulk of this migration has been completed and we discuss it largely for reference."

This is a sign of a local installation that has not yet been migrated to UTF-8. If, instead, you see question marks instead of accented letters — even if these question marks seem to also replace a character that should have followed the accented letter — it is likely that your installation is already configured for UTF-8 and that you have been sent a document encoded in Western ISO."

The Japanese word <foreignphrase>mojibake</foreignphrase> has been adopted to describe this phenomenon.

msgid "There are two time sources in a computer. A computer's motherboard has a hardware clock, called the “CMOS clock”. This clock is not very precise, and provides rather slow access times. The operating system kernel has its own, the software clock, which it keeps up to date with its own means (possibly with the help of time servers, see the “Time Synchronization” section). This system clock is generally more accurate, especially since it doesn't need access to hardware variables. However, since it only exists in live memory, it is zeroed out every time the machine is booted, contrary to the CMOS clock, which has a battery and therefores “survives” rebooting or halting of the machine. The system clock is, thus, set from the CMOS clock during boot, and the CMOS clock is updated on shutdown (to take into account possible changes or corrections if it has been improperly adjusted)."
msgstr ""

#. Tag: para
#, no-c-format
msgid "In practice, there is a problem, since the CMOS clock is nothing more than a counter and contains no information regarding the time zone. There is a choice to make regarding its interpretation: either the system considers it runs in universal time (UTC, formerly GMT), or in local time. This choice could be a simple shift, but things are actually more complicated: as a result of daylight saving time, this offset is not constant. The result is that the system has no way to determine whether the offset is correct, especially around periods of time change. Since it is always possible to reconstruct local time from universal time and the timezone information, we strongly recommend using the CMOS clock in universal time."

#. Tag: para

msgid "Unfortunately, Windows systems in their default configuration ignore this recommendation; they keep the CMOS clock on local time, applying time changes when booting the computer by trying to guess during time changes if the change has already been applied or not. This works relatively well, as long as the system has only Windows running on it. But when a computer has several systems (whether it be a “dual-boot” configuration or running other systems via virtual machine), chaos ensues, with no means to determine if the time is correct. If you absolutely must retain Windows on a computer, you should either configure it to keep the CMOS clock as UTC, or deactivate <literal>UTC</literal> in the <filename>/etc/default/rcS</filename> file on the Debian system (and make sure to manually check your clock in spring and autumn)."
